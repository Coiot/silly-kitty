    or feral) living in North West Arkansas by providing low cost spay/neuter, TNR

  text: TNR is a comprehensive plan where entire feral colonies are humanely trapped,
    then evaluated, vaccinated, and neutered by veterinarians. Kittens and cats that
    are tame enough to be adopted are placed in good homes. Adult cats are returned
    to their familiar habitat to live out their lives under the watchful care of sympathetic
    neighborhood volunteers.
