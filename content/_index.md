  text: TNR is a comprehensive plan where entire feral colonies are humanely trapped,
    then evaluated, vaccinated, and neutered by veterinarians. Kittens and cats that
    are tame enough to be adopted are placed in good homes. Adult cats are returned
    to their familiar habitat to live out their lives under the watchful care of sympathetic
    neighborhood volunteers.

  title: Our Vision
  subtitle: |-
    To have a community where no kittens are born wild, where no cat capable of living in a home is lacking one, and where no community cats go wanting for food, water, and appropriate care and concern.

    Keep coming back to our page to see updates on our blog about where we are hosting clinics, offering services, and showing some of the cats we've helped find a new home.
