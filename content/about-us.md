### Volunteer

If you would like to volunteer to help community cats in NWA, please email us with your contact information, location, and if you have any particular interests or limitations. We always need volunteers who are willing to learn and participate in trap, neuter, return efforts. We also have occasional need for volunteers to feed community cats. We also have occasional need for volunteers will to help with fundraising and outreach events.

### Care for Community Cats

If you are caring for, or know of cats who need assistance, please email us at [nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com](mailto:nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com) with details about the cat(s) in need, as well as your location, and a phone number where we can reach you.

### Adopt

While our main focus is on spay/neuter and not on fostering and adoption, we often have adoptable kitties in our care. Take a look at [our adoptable cats and kittens on AdoptaPet](https://www.adoptapet.com/shelter/195015-nwa-community-cat-project-fayetteville-arkansas)
