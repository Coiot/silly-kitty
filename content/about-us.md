The Northwest Arkansas Community Cat Project is a 501 (c) 3, Non-Profit organization. We are 100% volunteer based, and every penny donated goes to the care of cats in our region. We network with local rescues, shelters, and other organization in our region to find help for stray, abandoned, and feral cats. This includes support for colony caretakers, as well as working to make affordable spay/neuter, vaccination, and other services available to cats in need. You can find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nwacommunitycatproject/ "Facebook Page") and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nwacommunitycatproject/ "Instagram Profile").

### Volunteers

If you would like to volunteer and help us with these efforts, you can also email us with your contact information, location, and if you have any particular interests or limitations, and we will do our best to match your availability with the needs we are presented with. We always seem to need volunteers to trap, transport to/from clinics/shelters/adoption events, foster (both short-term and long-term, we provide all the supplies!), as well as help with fundraising and campaign efforts.

### Caretakers

If you are caring for, or know of cats who need assistance, please email us at [nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com](mailto:nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com "Emails us at this address.") with details about the cat(s) in need, as well as your location, and a phone number where we can reach you at.
