The Northwest Arkansas Community Cat Project is a 501 (c) 3, Non-Profit organization. We are 100% volunteer based, and every penny donated goes to the care of cats in our region. We network with local rescues, shelters, and other organization in our region to find help for stray, abandoned, and feral cats. This includes support for colony caretakers, as well as working to make affordable spay/neuter, vaccination, and other services available to cats in need.

If you are caring for, or know of cats who need assistance, please email us at nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com with details about the cat(s) in need, as well as your location, and a phone number where we can reach you at.

Fayetteville, AR Residents: According to Fayetteville City Ordinance, "A caretaker of a feral cat colony who is properly registered with the approved animal welfare organization and in compliance with all caretaker duties stated above shall be exempt from ยง92.22 Running at Large Prohibited subsections (C) and (D) only for allowing properly managed feral cats from running at large. To apply for caretaker status, please email us at nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com We have provided the initial forms for you to download and view (or fill out, if you can print), so that you can see what information we will need. Registration with us is completely free, and we would be more than happy to help you and your colony!

If you would like to volunteer and help us with these efforts, you can also email us with your contact information, location, and if you have any particular interests or limitations, and we will do our best to match your availability with the needs we are presented with. We always seem to need volunteers to trap, transport to/from clinics/shelters/adoption events, foster (both short-term and long-term, we provide all the supplies!), as well as help with fundraising and campaign efforts.

You can find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Our fundraising campaign is thru Go Fund Me - NWACCP
