### Volunteer

If you would like to volunteer and help us with these efforts, please email us with your contact information, location, and if you have any particular interests or limitations, and we will do our best to match your availability with the needs we are presented with. We always need volunteers to trap, transport to/from clinics/shelters/adoption events, foster (both short-term and long-term, we provide all the supplies!), as well as help with fundraising and campaign efforts.

### Care for Community Cats

If you are caring for, or know of cats who need assistance, please email us at [nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com](mailto:nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com "Emails us at this address.") with details about the cat(s) in need, as well as your location, and a phone number where we can reach you.
