She was the first one to be curious about exploring the rest of the house. She's very inquisitive, and definitely the leader of her group! :) She & Benji tend to sleep and play more together so it would be great if they got a home together, but of course could be adopted individually as well.  We will offer an adoption discount for them if a family would like to adopt them together."
