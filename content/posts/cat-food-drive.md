subtitle = "![](/images/CAT FOOD DRIVE! (1).jpg)\n\nNWA Community Cat Project needs YOUR help! With the current pandemic we are focusing our efforts on keeping families together. This includes the feline members of the family, as well as helping colony and community cat caretakers. We are having a cat food drive! If you can spare an extra bag of food, please consider helping us. We have a no contact collection location:\n\nFayetteville Animal Services\n\n1640 S. Armstrong Ave.\n\nFayetteville, AR 72701\n\nYou can drop off food on the benches out front and we will collect if from there. Alternatively, you can order online from our Amazon wishlist here: [https://a.co/fyL5LDw](https://a.co/fyL5LDw \"NWACCP\") (Our wishlist is merely a sample, ANY cat food is GREATLY appreciated!)\n\nDo you need assistance with cat food?
