These are but a few of the cats we’ve assisted in our area. Thanks to the diligent care and love from their dedicated caretakers, each of these sweet, shy kitties are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and given proper care. Best of all, none of them will ever struggle with raising kittens, or experiencing the instinctive drive to fight for breeding territory.
