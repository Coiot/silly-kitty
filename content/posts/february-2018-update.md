We need help!!! The Friends of Prairie Grove Pound and the NWA Community Cat Project have hosted monthly, low-cost spay/neuter clinics for cats here in Northwest Arkansas for the last two years.

We’ve spayed and neutered more than 800 cats since we first began, and considering we only do this once per month, we know we’re on the right track to reducing the pet overpopulation crisis we have in this region. As a result, Prairie Grove has seen a 46% decrease in the number of feline intakes – EVEN THOUGH cats from all over the region have been vetted at these clinics, not just cats from Prairie Grove. That’s HUGE!

Thanks to the generous support of the Prairie Grove city management, we have been holding these clinics in a city building, as makeshift space. However… By the end of this year, we will no longer have access to this space!!!!

The City of Prairie Grove has most generously granted space to build a new facility next to the existing animal shelter. An equally generous donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, has donated the materials for a NEW, 30′ x 100′ metal building. A local Architect has even volunteered his time, and full services for this project.

So, why are we fundraising $50,000, you may ask? We still need a foundation, initial plumbing & electrical services, as well as finish-out materials.

The best news about this clinic is, once built, we will be offer to provide services for cats AND dogs!!! We don’t place income or residency restrictions on participants. We offer spay/neuter, annual vaccines, deworming, and microchips for all the pets we assist.

Without this new facility, we cannot continue to offer such low-cost services, period. These low cost services are *critical* to our expanded area of small towns and rural farming communities. Quite often, for those living in rural areas, it is not easy for owners to get their pets to the veterinarian due to the distance they must drive, and many often end up with unwanted litter after litter. It is a situation which can very quickly get out of control, leaving both the animals and their owners distraught and stressed.

If you can afford to donate even one dollar, please do! We are anxious to keep the progress we’re already seeing going, and we simply cannot do it without a new space to offer this assistance. If you cannot assist, we hope you will still share our campaign, and help us raise awareness for our cause.

We have two donation links setup:
