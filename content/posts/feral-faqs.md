### **1\]** What is a feral cat?

A feral cat is either a cat who has lived his whole life with little or no human contact and is not socialized, or a stray cat who was lost or abandoned and has lived away from human contact long enough to revert to a wild state. Feral cats avoid human contact and cannot be touched by strangers.

### **2\]** Are stray cats and feral cats the same?

No, stray and feral cats are not the same, and the terms stray cat and feral cat are not interchangeable. A stray cat is a domestic cat who was abandoned or strayed from home and became lost. Because a stray was once a companion animal, he can usually be re-socialized and adopted. Adult feral cats usually cannot be tamed and are not suited to living indoors with people. They are most content living in their established territory. Feral kittens up to about 8 to 10 weeks, however, can often be tamed and adopted. If you are willing to foster and socialize the litter of kittens you have discovered, the better the outcome will be for the kittens and for the colony as a whole. The term ‘community cats’ includes both feral and stray cats.

### **3\]** How can I tell if a cat is stray or feral?

Observe the cats appearance and behavior. A stray cat is likely to approach you, though not always close enough for you to touch him. If you put food down, a stray cat will likely start to eat it right away. A stray cat is often vocal, and may look disheveled, as if he is unaccustomed to dealing with conditions on the street. A feral cat is often silent and will not approach humans. A feral cat has adapted to conditions and is likely to be well groomed. If you put food down for a feral cat, he will wait until you move away from the area before approaching the food.

### **4\]** I would like to find good homes for the feral cats I have been feeding. Is this possible?

Generally, no. Adult feral cats usually cannot be socialized and will not adjust to living indoors. A great deal of time and effort can go into attempting to tame an adult feral cat, with no assurance of success. This time and effort is far better spent sterilizing feral cats to break the cycle of reproduction. See Alley Cat Allies Fact sheet, [Why Trap-Neuter-Return is the Solution to Feral Cat Overpopulation and Trap Neuter Adopt is Not]([https://www.alleycat.org/resources/why-its-trap-neuter-return-not-trap-neuter-adopt/]\(https://www.alleycat.org/resources/why-its-trap-neuter-return-not-trap-neuter-adopt/ ). Stray cats and kittens up to 8 or 10 weeks of age can usually be socialized and placed in homes.

### **5\]** What about a feral cat sanctuary or a barn home for these cats?

It is very difficult to relocate feral cats. Most barn homes already have an abundance of feral cats. Feral cats are extremely bonded to their territories and will often try to find their way back home, and in the process, get killed by traffic, predators, or die from starvation, injuries, and the elements in their attempt to make their journey home.

If you were to trap and remove an entire colony of cats, in a short time, a new colony of cats will quickly move in and take advantage of the newly vacated territory and will reproduce and start the cycle over again. You are back to square one. This phenomenon is known as [The Vacuum Effect]([http://4fi8v2446i0sw2rpq2a3fg51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5FastFacts-FeralCatsandtheVacuumEffect.pdf]\(http://4fi8v2446i0sw2rpq2a3fg51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5FastFacts-FeralCatsandtheVacuumEffect.pdf ). Trap and remove is not a practical, long term solution to effectively and humanely control feral cat populations. Our organization does NOT come and remove unwanted feral cats.

Fortunately, there is a solution. Feral cat colonies can be managed with a nonlethal method called Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR), in which cats are humanely (painlessly) trapped, spayed or neutered, and returned to their colony site where caregivers provide them with food, water, and shelter. Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is the only chance feral cats have of living safe, healthy lives without reproducing.

### **6\]** I discovered a cat outside. What should I do?

The first step is to determine if the cat is tame or wild by observing the cat’s behavior in its environment and reaction to you

If the cat is tame, is may belong to people living in the neighborhood. Ask the neighbors if they know who that cat belongs to or who cares for it. The next step would be to scan the cat for a microchip. If you can get close enough to the cat to pet it and you can safely pick it up and get it in a carrier, any vet office or shelter will be able to scan the cat for a chip, which hopefully will be registered with the owner’s information! Also, report the found cat to the local animal shelter in case the cat’s humans have reported it missing.

If talking to neighbors, checking for a chip, and reporting to the shelter doesn’t help locate the cat’s humans, post found cat flyers throughout the neighborhood, and consider doing the the following:

Register the cat online at www.pets911.com in the Found Pet section.

Register the cat online at [Arkansas Lost and Found Pet Network]([http://alfpetnetwork.com/]\(http://alfpetnetwork.com/ ).

Post the cat on the [Lost & Found Pets, NWA]([https://www.facebook.com/groups/100422443380442/]\(https://www.facebook.com/groups/100422443380442/ ) Facebook page.    NOTE:  Many smaller towns, and even neighborhoods, have their own Facebook page/group, so make sure to post to any and all in your area!

Post the cat on the [Nextdoor]([https://nextdoor.com/]\(https://nextdoor.com/ ) website or App.  (This is a private environment for neighborhoods all across the country.  Registration is free, as are all postings.)

Feral cats can be managed with Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR), in which cats are humanely (painlessly) trapped, spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and returned to their colony site where caregivers provide them with food, water, and shelter.

Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is the only chance feral cats have of living safe, healthy lives without reproducing. By fixing the cats that are at your location and keeping them there, this will keep out other cats (that are unaltered) from moving in and quickly repopulating the area.

### 7\] I have been feeding cats for a while and they are reproducing. What should I do?

Have them spayed/neutered as soon as possible. Email us at: nwacommunitycatproject@gmail.com to book appointments. If the cats are truly feral, you will need to trap the cats using humane traps (let us know if you need to borrow some) to have them spayed or neutered. Do not trap cats until the day/night before their scheduled appointments! Never release a cat the same day it has been spayed/neutered.

Trapping feral cats sounds complicated; in reality, it’s a simple and rewarding process, and it doesn't hurt the cats. Once the cats are spayed/neutered and vaccinated, return them (after overnight recovery) to the place where they were trapped. You should then provide ongoing food, shelter, and care to keep the cats healthy and safe. You may want to talk to some of your neighbors/family/friends/coworkers who may be willing to help you feed the cats a few days each week, or would be willing to donate cat food once the cats have been fixed. [Visit Alley Cat Allies]([https://www.alleycat.org/]\(https://www.alleycat.org/ ) for more information on trapping.

### 8\] I can’t touch the cats, so how can I get them to the vet for spay/neutering?

Do not try to touch them! And _never_ attempt to catch a cat by throwing a towel or blanket over just the cat. Never use tranquilizers on outdoor cats as the risk of injury (to you and to the cat) is too great. The day/night before their spay/neuter appointment, trap the cats using humane traps and have them spayed/neutered and vaccinated (we can help guide you thru this process). Immediately after the cat is in the trap, cover the trap with an old sheet or beach towel. This will help keep the cat calm. Failure to cover trapped cats results in the cat injuring herself trying to escape from the trap. Don't wait to fix the cats! Thinking the cats will get used to human presence and become tame enough to catch in a regular cat carrier, wastes time during which a cat could be come pregnant and soon there will be many more cats that need to be trapped! The cat may never be tame enough, and while you wait, several litters of kittens will be born. For specific information about traps and trapping, go to [Alley Cat Allies - Successful Trapping]([https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/steps-for-a-successful-trapping-day/]\(https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/steps-for-a-successful-trapping-day/ ).

### 9\] There are several cats to be trapped, but I only have one trap. Will that do?

Generally, no. The NWA Community Cat Project has free loaner traps available, along with instructions on how to use them. Please thoroughly clean and disinfect the traps you use before returning the traps to us. Ideally, you should have as many traps as there are cats. If not, aim to trap all the cats in two or three sessions. How many cats you can trap during each session also depends on how many your vet, or the clinic will sterilize at one time, and the recovery spaces you have available for cats to recoup from their surgery. For more information about trapping feral cats, along with information on recommended traps, go to [Alley Cat Allies - Trapping Equipment]([https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/trapping-equipment/]\(https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/trapping-equipment/ ).

### 10\] I think the cat may be pregnant, can she still be spayed?

Yes, female cats can still be spayed while they are pregnant.

### 11\] What if the cat is lactating? Can she still be spayed?

Female cats can still be spayed while they are lactating. However, you should make every effort to locate her kittens and know the approximate age of the kittens. Female cats can still get pregnant while they are nursing a previous litter, and cats are only pregnant for approximately eight weeks.

### 12\] How old do kittens need to be to be fixed at the feral cat clinic?

Kittens need to be approximately three months old or three pounds to go under the type of anesthesia used at spay/neuter clinics.

### 13\] My neighbor is feeding cats, but not fixing any of them. What can I do to help?

Let your neighbor know that low cost spay/neuter services are available through our program. Give them our contact information and offer to help with the logistics of getting the colony fixed. Many times, people just get overwhelmed with the day to day care of the cats, and don't know where to start to get the situation under control. They may not be aware that low cost spay/neuter services are available.

### 14\] I have a lot of feral cats in my backyard that I feed. I am afraid if I start bringing them in to be fixed, I will get in trouble for having too many cats and they will be taken away from me.

The NWA Community Cat Project is a volunteer based organization with a mission to humanely control feral cat populations through low cost spay/neuter services. We are not interested in taking your cats away or in judging you for the number of cats you feed! We want to help you keep your ferals safe, healthy and in manageable numbers.
