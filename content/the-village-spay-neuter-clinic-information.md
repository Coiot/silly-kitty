In collaboration with the Friends of Prairie Grove Pound, we sponsor monthly/bi-monthly low cost spay/neuter clinics for cats.

At this time, this page is strictly informative for **_scheduled_** participants for the following clinic dates:

* **Saturday, February 13th, 2021**
* **Saturday, March 13th, 2021**

**BASIC INSTRUCTIONS**:

* Each cat needs to be in their own carrier, kennel, or trap.
* NO soft side or fabric carriers.
* Kittens MUST weigh 3.5lbs (roughly 3 1/2 months of age).
* NO fabric or blankets in the carriers, only newspaper (or wee pads) please.
* No food or water after midnight the night before surgery.
* PLEASE place a label on each carrier with your name, your cat's name, and your phone number.  Taping a card or paper note with this info on the carrier works well.
* Payment isn't due until pick-up, cash or check only (NO cards, sorry).
* Pick-up times can vary.  **A volunteer will text you once your cat(s) are awake enough for discharge.**
