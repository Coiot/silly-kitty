*   Drop off time is between 8-9am.

*   Please place a label on each carrier with your cat’s name, your name, and your phone number.
    
*   For speedier checkin, please print, fill out, and bring the clinic intake form with you to your cat’s appointment. \[[Clinic intake form](https://nwacommunitycatproject.org/images/Clinic%20intake%20form%20Jan%202026.pdf)\] Please complete a form for each cat you are bringing to the clinic.

**Location:**
