### **BASIC INSTRUCTIONS**:

*   Appointments required.
    
*   Drop off time is between 8-9am.
    
*   Kittens must weigh 3lbs (roughly 3 months of age).
    
*   No food after midnight the night before surgery (leaving water out is okay).
    
*   Each cat needs to be in their own carrier or trap.
    
*   Hard sided carriers are much preferred over fabric carriers.
    
*   Please have only the cat (and a pee pad, cardboard pad, or newspapers) in the carrier/trap. No blankets, towels, or other non-disposable objects.
    
*   Please place a label on each carrier with your cat’s name, your name, and your phone number.
    
*   For speedier checkin, please print, fill out, and bring the clinic intake form with you to your cat’s appointment. \[[Clinic intake form](/images/NWA%20CCP%20Clinic%20intake%20Form%20Oct%202025.pdf)\] Please complete a form for each cat you are bringing to the clinic.
